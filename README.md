# OverTheWire-Bandit🏴‍☠️💰

<h2>Description</h2>
<b>Over The Wire (https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) has a number of wargames you can play through to sharpen your skills and learn new skills using bash. I played through the "Bandit" wargame to test my skills and learn new ones in my journey to master bash & become a Cloud Engineer ☁️👨🏿‍💻☁️. Each of the levels and the bash commands I used to beat each level will be shown below.

<br />
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<b>To get started I downloaded Ubuntu ver 24.04 and set up the VM using Oracle Virtual Box.

<h2>Level 1</h2>
<b> To log into the Bandit Linux server you need to use SSH. LogOn.sh shows the command & how I used it to get logged into the server. The prompt for Level 1 is below. </b>
<br />
<b>
"The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game."
